				The processing of time series, i.e., of data containing a relevant time organization for the problem to be solved, appears in multiple technological applications. We can find it for instance in the prediction of economic indicators, in the behavior of biomedical values, in the study of the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, or in the analysis of sign language.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this final degree project, the study of the influence of different types of input coding, as well as data preprocessing techniques, on the efficiency in classification of multivariate time series it is proposed. All these details will be analyzed on machine learning models of neural networks such as multilayer networks, recurrent networks (RNN) or convolutional networks (CNN).
			</p>
			<p>
				The study will use time series of sign language resulting from analyzing the position of the hand at different moments over time. This representative example will allow us to test different models and evaluate the results of each of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once all the proposed techniques are studied, they will be put into practice on two data sets corresponding to sign language. The results will be analyzed in order to indicate which encodings, data processing techniques and neural network models improve the representation of the time structure, in order to obtain greater precision in the classification of multivariate time series.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, we will bring out the relevance of multivariate time series in the field of artificial intelligence and we will discuss which are the possible applications that can be derived from this study.
